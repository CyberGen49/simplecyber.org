    <h1>Welcome to SimpleCyber.org!</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm <b>Kaleb</b>, also known online as <b>CyberGen49</b>, <b>CyberOfficial</b>, or just simply, <b>Cyber</b>, and I'm a student majoring in Computer Information Systems at the University of Houston. I've finally gotten around to putting together a simple landing site for my domain, <b>simplecyber.org</b> (which you're looking at right now), and I want to use this place to tell you about myself and share some projects I'm working on.</p>
    <p>It's not super fancy, but it's better than nothing, right?</p>

    <!-- <h2>The old site</h2>
    <p>An old site exists that's much more Minecraft-focused, since it was created for my Minecraft server brand, "The SimpleCyber Network". A more SCN-focused story is told there, which you may or may not be interested in, and I've written some articles there as well.</p>
    <p>It's created with Google Sites, has a painfully slow load time, and I haven't touched it in well over a year. Visit at your own risk!</p>

    <h2>My story</h2>
    <p>Throughout my early life, I was always mesmerized by the light and colour produced by screens. I would sit in front of the TV for hours, my eyes glued to the small CRT display - not because of what was playing, but because I just liked looking at it.</p>
    <p>I started this whole adventure with an interest in photography in my elementary school years. So much so as to have a picture I took of our dog featured in the display case at our local library. I would spend a big portion of the early 2010s taking hundreds of pictures of anything I thought looked interesting, even if most of them would go unnoticed.</p>
    <p>My earliest exposure to the computer was when I'd sit down and mess with Microsoft Word and Paint on our eMachines ET-1161 running Windows Vista. My dad had also showed me how to move pictures from my camera to the computer. Later on, that would progress into playing random flash games on Coolmath Games.</p>
    <p>Eventually, my parents got new computers, so the old eMachines fell to me. Once that was in my hands, I would do the same things I did before, but I'd have more time to play around with it. Things as simple as changing the desktop background and messing with an extra scanner we had laying around kept me entertained.</p>
    <p>In 2014, I heard a lot of my friends talking about a game called Minecraft. I had still only been playing flash games at this point. We didn't (and still don't) have game consoles at home, since my mom was under the impression that all modern video games were full of violence and gore. I took it upon myself to explain to my parents that Minecraft wasn't like that, and, later that year, they got it for me.</p>
    <p>I feel pretty safe saying that Minecraft would come to make me who I am today, in a very, very roundabout way.</p>
    <p>That game would lead me to learning how to safely use the internet by avoiding scammy ads and such, and it would fuel my newfound interest in computers. By downloading and installing Minecraft worlds, resource packs, and mods, I would inevitably learn how the Windows filesystem works.</p>
    <p>Throughout 2015 and 2016, I would spend a lot of my time tinkering around with my laptop, an old Toshiba Satellite L775. I would install visual styles to make the Windows 7 installation look completely different, and I would attempt to modify other parts of the OS, which would normally end up breaking the system. As I played with the only computer I had, I was forced to learn a lot of handy troubleshooting techniques and fixes that prove useful to this day. I still had the old eMachines, but it had become so slow, it couldn't stand up to what I wanted to do with it.</p>
    <p>This interest in computers would become even more apparent as I got into home-hosting Minecraft servers in 2017. By this time, I had collected a fair few old computers that I could play with. As I collected more hardware, I could set up dedicated systems for hosting my servers. I would get into minimal Windows installations, and eventually into Linux, so I could squeeze every ounce of performance out of the weak computers I was using.</p>
    <p>I would end up hosting several public servers over the next few years. All of them flopped after a few months, and none of them attracted very many people. Despite that, I made quite a few friends along the way. Even though I don't host public servers anymore, me and those friends from back then have formed a private group, where we still play Minecraft.</p>
    <p>Throughout my time server hosting, I would pick up both the Windows and Linux shell-scripting languages: Batch, and Bash, respectively. I would use these languages to write all sorts of scripts to automate everyday tasks on all my systems.</p>
    <p>In 2019, I got tired of always existing inside a command line, so I branched out to developing skins (interactive widgets) for a desktop customization tool called <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/" target="_blank">Rainmeter</a>. This was a breath of fresh air! Before this point, if I wanted to make something graphically, I was limited to creating nonfunctional concept art in a graphic design program. My skins (like <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/cybergen49/art/SpotiPlayer-for-Rainmeter-813654412" target="_blank">SpotiPlayer</a>) would prove to be very popular among the community, generating tens of thousands of views online. In early 2020, I set up a Discord server so people could get help with my creations, but I would slowly get burnt out and stop developing for Rainmeter.</p>
    <p>Despite my Rainmeter burnout, I still had an urge to develop graphical interfaces, so, in August of 2020, I decided to pick up web development. This was big. The more I played, the more I learned. HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, SQL. Slowly, I've built up my web dev knowledge to the point where I feel like I could remake a lot of existing websites better than they were made originally.</p>
    <p>This brings us to today. I've graduated high school and I'm working my way through college. I feel like I've kind of gotten a taste of everything so far, and I enjoy doing all of it, so I chose a fairly generic IT major to maybe help me find my way. I have, however, made it clear in my mind that I don't want to be a programmer. Programming is something that I enjoy doing in my free time, and I feel like having someone tell me exactly what I need to do would ruin that fun for me.</p>
    <p>The future has yet to happen. Who knows what's next? I'll try not to forget to update this story when anything new or revolutionary happens.</p>
