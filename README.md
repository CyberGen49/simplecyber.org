The [simplecyber.org](https://simplecyber.org) website.

Even though I've gotten much more into Javascript-driven site experiences with projects like CyberFiles and CyberVideoPlayer, PHP seems like the best option for this type of thing. All of the tools are still powered by JS though, since that'll minimize the amount of server contact and leave processing to the user's system.

I initially intended to host this thing on GitHub Pages, but not having access to PHP would mean manually reusing a lot of code from page to page, which is something I try to avoid. Instead, I'm hosting this site from home.
